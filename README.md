OpenRegatta
===========

OpenRegatta is a project that aims to uses information captured by sailboat instruments, transmits them over wifi and offer clear display though an android app.

The main purpose are:
- To suggest a way of transmitting NMEA information over WiFi
- To overcome the limitation of some existing displays by providing open source tools that allows anyone to build their own display
- To potentially offer data storage and race analysis features so manoeuver and racing tackticks can be analysed later.

Everything necessary to build an instance of an OpenRegatta system should be decribed in the Wiki pages. For now we're only at the step of prototyping, once validated the app will be available on the Google Play app store and we can potentially help/guide people though installation of the hardware.
